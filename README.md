# RES Calculators üî¢

### This project contains three distinct calcualtors combined under a single domain
- photovoltaic,
- photovoltaic for Companys,
- heat pumps,
- heat home


<br/>


### ‚ö°App was designed to:


1. Speed up the work of
sales professionals within the renewable energy sector. These
calculators serve as basic tools for estimating installation costs of
various renewable energy sources. 

2. Eliminate different versions. The previous calculator was created in ``excel``, and salespeople were given ready-made sheets. This caused many employees have different versions of the calculator.

 ### üìñ Tech Stack:
- T3 stack ( trpc, React, Next-Auth, Prisma, zustand as state menegment, TailwindCSS )
- Vercel,
- AWS S3 Bucket / Amazon RDS

> [!NOTE] 
>Data storage was divided into two services:
> - AWS s3 bucket to store the file with data necessary for calculations and files to  download,
> - Amazon RDS for user data.

## üßñüèΩ Entire web application is split between 3 roles:
### Admin:
  - create/remove menagers and salesmans,
  - change prices of each element,
  - change the imposed commission for menagers and salesmans,
  - post fresh news into /aktualnosci subpage,
  - use calculators, generates offers for clients,
  - adding / removing additional files for clients,
### Menager:
  - create/remove salesmans that works underneath him,
  - change the imposed commission for his salesmans,
  - use calculators, generates offers for clients
  - download additional files for clients
### Salesman:

> [!IMPORTANT]
>## What I've learned
>First of all I've learned how to work with commercial client and fit to his requirments. For sure I've refined knowledge in React, app optymalizations, write code in clean way, split components into reusable, smaller pieces, read friendly folder structure, pass props between functions, zustand is another state menager I've come to know. 
Trpc was used rather schematicly but in readable and clean way. I've mastered the basics on AWS s3 bucket scope, that's why gathering data there will no be the problem no more, despite not friendly UI/UX entire platform.
