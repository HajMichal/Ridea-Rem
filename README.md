# OZE Calculator ðŸ”¢

This project contains three distinct calcualtors
combined under a single domain, designed to speed up the work of
sales professionals within the renewable energy sector. These
calculators serve as basic tools for estimating installation costs of
various renewable energy sources. The project was built using the
T3 stack, that includes trpc, React, React-Query, Next-Auth, and
Prisma. For hosting, I used Vercel, data storage was divided into
two services: planetscale to store user data, AWS s3 bucket to store
the file with data necessary for calculations.
